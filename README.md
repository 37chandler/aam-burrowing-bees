# Burrowing Bees

This assignment is *required*. In it, you're asked to simulate 
an experiment done by a biologist researching bees to see 
if the results the biologist saw are the results of chance.

The markdown file `burrowing_bees.rmd` holds the initial data
and the questions for you to answer.
